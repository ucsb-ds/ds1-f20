## UCSB DS1 Data Science Foundations, Fall 2020, taught by Prof. K

Welcome to the course!

Data is everywhere, and each of us has access to data on virtually any topic imaginable via the internet. However, access to _data_ is not the same thing as access to _information_. The purpose of this course is to develop some of the foundational skills needed to consume data and create information. The main theme in the course is understanding the sources of data, the variability inherent in data, and the inherent uncertainty associated with conclusions drawn from data.

The course teaches critical concepts and skills in computer programming and statistical inference, in conjunction with hands-on analysis of real-world datasets from a variety of disciplines.

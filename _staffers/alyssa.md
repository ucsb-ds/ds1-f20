Hey everyone, my name is Alyssa!!! I’m a third year Statistics and Data Science Major with a minor in Geographical Spatial Science. I'm so excited to be tutoring for the first time in CS90DA!!! When I took this class last fall with Prof K, I was a pre-math major. After realizing I liked coding and analyzing data, I decided to change my major to data science :) Despite coming in with limited knowledge of coding, this class made me a lot more confident and I was able to breeze through my other computer science classes. As a former student of this class, one piece of advice I can give you is that you should always ask for help. When it comes to coding, there are no dumb questions. The teaching staff is still learning so anything and anyone can improve. Outside of school, I like to play tennis, go to the beach, play with my dogs and watch Korean Dramas. I’m also the publicity chair for Iaorana Te Otea, UCSB’s Polynesian Dance and Drumming Club. We offer many opportunities for dancers and drummers to perform. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me directly on piazza or during our lab/lecture zoom sessions!!! I look forward to helping you this quarter!!!!

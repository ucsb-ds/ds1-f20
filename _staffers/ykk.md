[Schedule an appointment (will be available Week 2)](#){: .btn .btn-outline }

Hi everyone! This is my third time teaching DS 1 (formerly, INT 5) but it's my first time doing so remotely. 
I am looking forward to implementing the new ways of introducing the Data Science material, which will help make learning easier and more engaging. 

When I am not sharing my passion for Computer Science and Data Science, you used to be able to find me chatting with students, organizing board-game nights, drinking copious amounts of tea, and/or enjoying the beautiful Santa Barbara weather.
This term, however, I'm going to be on the other side of the world (11-12 time zones ahead of Santa Barbara); so while I'll still be drinking lots and lots of tea and trying to organize game nights, you might also see the results of my roaming around the city with my camera reflected in my Zoom backgrounds.

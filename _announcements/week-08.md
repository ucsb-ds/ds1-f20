Dear DS 1 students,

If you are struggling with anything in particular, feel free to start a follow-up discussion for this post on Piazza (remember that you can also post anonymously, if you feel more comfortable not sharing your name).
You can also review the material during the [office hours or schedule an appointment with Prof. K]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link calendar.md %}#office-hours).

* **Project 1** has been posted. _Start on it right away_!
* As usual for labs, which are always due before the next lab, Lab08 will be due on the same day as the Project 1 draft. Lab08 should help you with the project, so I recommend working on them in tandem, especially, since Lab08 largely echoes Lab07.
* After you submit your Project 1 draft on Wednesday, you have until Friday to finalize your submission. Use the office hours throughout the week to get feedback from the mentors on your project.

We wish you a **Happy Thanksgiving** and a wonderful long weekend!
